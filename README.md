# Onegin
This program is able to sort strings in alphabetical order:
  1) from the beginning of the line;
  2) from the end of the line

For example, a file is attached to the project `onegin.txt`,
where the poem by A.S. Pushkin in English will be published.

For the beginning of the program: 
  1) download the project 
  2) enter the command in the console `./onegin <name input file> <name output file>.` 
  Where `<name input file>` can be entered onegin.txt or any other file you want. 
  And `<name output file>` you need to write the name of the file where the sorted text will be loaded.
  
The output to the file is as follows:
  1) Original text
  2) Sorted text at the beginning of the line
  3) Sorted text from the end of the line
