In fair round belly with good capon lined,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
All the world's a stage,
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
And all the men and women merely players;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
They have their exits and their entrances,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
That ends this strange eventful history,
