All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
Seeking the bubble reputation
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
That ends this strange eventful history,
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
They have their exits and their entrances,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
